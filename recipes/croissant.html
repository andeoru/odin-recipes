    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These are so fun! The buttery, flaky layers are so tender and crispy on the outside. Could fill with ice cream, fruit and whipped cream or yogurt, pizza sauce with cheese and toppings, chicken or egg salad, or scrambled eggs and bacon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 12x60-inch pieces heavy-duty aluminum foil</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Position an oven rack in the bottom of the oven. Turn a 12-cup muffin tin upside down. Wrap the long side of each piece of foil around the bottom rim of one upside-down muffin cup and shape into a 6-inch tall cone to use as a mold. Repeat on alternating cups to make 6 molds; lightly spray foil cones and muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Unroll crescent dough sheets on a lightly floured surface and gently press perforations together to form two 13x8-inch rectangles. Cut each rectangle into six 1 1/4x13-inch strips. Working with one foil cone at a time, wrap 2 dough strips up and around foil cone, beginning at and base, and slightly overlapping. Pinching to seal the second dough strip to the first, and pinching seams and tip to seal. Repeat with remaining dough strips and foil cones. Brush cones with beaten egg white.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Carefully remove from oven, remove cones (with foil still attached) from muffin tin, and place cones upside-down on a wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with topping of choice, if desired. Let cool completely on wire rack, about 15 minutes. Remove foil from ice cream cones by pinching foil together, gently twisting and pulling. Fill as desired.</li>
    </ol>
